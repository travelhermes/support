# Profile

## What can you do?

From your profile, you can manage the data we know about you. This data is divided into 3 parts:

- Account
- Security
- Advanced

## Account

In this section, you will be able to change your first and last name and your email address. Also, similar to the registration process, you will be able to update your preferences.

### Logout

In the account section, you will also be able to log out of Hermes. To do this, use the "Logout" button.

You will be redirected to the main page once the logout is done.

## Security

If you need to change your password, you can change it here. We recommend that you change your password if you believe someone has gained access to your account, or if unauthorized access has occurred on a platform other than Hermes where you have used the same email address and password.

When you change your password, all sessions except the current one will be closed.

## Advanced

You are in control of your data. From here you can download all your data or delete your Hermes account. We will only ask you to confirm your password.
