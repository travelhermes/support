## How to create an account

Creating an account in Hermes consists of three steps:

- Enter main data
- Enter preferences
- Rate sites

## Personal data

In the first step, you must enter the following data:

- First and last name
- Your e-mail address
- Password

  ![Personal data entry screen](../../assets/account/signup_1.png){ width="300" }

</figure>

These data are necessary for the correct functioning of the platform and to be able to address you if necessary.

Your personal data is safe. We do not share any data with third parties and you can always consult and delete them from your profile.

We recommend you to use a password between 8 and 16 characters long and different from the one you use in other services. This is encrypted in our database using the bcrypt algorithm and no one but you can know it.

## Initial preferences

In the next step, we need to know a little more about you. In this section, you must select at least 3 categories. These categories are classified into 12 different super categories.

<figure markdown>
  ![Initial preferences input screen](../../assets/account/signup_2.png){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>Step 2. Initial preferences</figcaption>
</figure>

The recommendations are based on your ratings and preferences. That's why we need this data.

## Initial ratings (Optional)

This step is optional, but as in the previous step, the recommendations are based on your ratings and preferences, that's why we need this data. In this last step, you will be able to rate sites you know.

<figure markdown>
  ![Score input screen](../../assets/account/signup_3.png){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>Step 3. Ratings</figcaption>
</figure>

For this, there are two options. In the first, you can search for sites you remember visiting. In the second, we show you random sites for you to rate if you have visited them. If you don't know any of these random sites, you can generate more with the "Load more sites" button.

When you click on a star, this will be the rating you assign to this place. You don't need to do anything else, as it is automatically saved.
