# Ratings

## Introduction

From the ratings section, you can manage all the ratings you have created in Hermes. This section is divided into two parts: pending ratings and completed ratings.

</figure>

**Pending ratings** will show sites that you have recently visited and that have appeared in at least one of your plans, while **completed ratings** will show all the ratings you have created.

## Create a new rating

If you want to rate a new site, you have two ways to do it. The first one, by clicking on the stars of a site in pending ratings.

Second, by clicking on the "Add rating" button. Clicking on that button will open a search panel where you can find the site you want.

<figure markdown>
  ![Search panel for a place to rate](../../assets/ratings/ratings_2.png){ width="300" }

</figure>

Once the desired site is found, click on one of the stars to create the rating.

<figure markdown>
  ![Results listing panel](../../assets/ratings/ratings_3.png){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>Search results</figcaption>
</figure>

When you click on a star, this will be the score you assign to this place. You won't need to do anything else, as it is automatically saved.

## Delete a rating

To delete a score, click on the "Delete" button next to it.

## Change a score

For the time being, you must first delete the score and then recreate it using the steps described above. This action is planned to be implemented in the future.
