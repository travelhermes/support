# Planning

## Introduction

The Hermes planner is the second main tool. Once you have created a plan from the recommendations, from the plan interface you can manage this or all the plans you have created.

## Plans

In Hermes, there are two types of plans:

- **Active plans**: These are plans in which today is between the start and end date of the plan or whose start date is in the future.
- **Past plans**: These are plans that have occurred in the past.

## States

In Hermes, a plan can be in one of the following states:

- **Planning**: Hermes is finishing planning your route. This can take up to 5 minutes.
- **Active**: This means that you are making the plan or it is pending to be made.
- **Completed**: This plan has already been completed.
- **Route not found**: Hermes could not find a route for your plan. You may have added too many sites or set too little time
    - Try deleting the plan and recreating it by reducing the number of sites or increasing the length of the day or the length of the trip.
- **Internal error**: An internal error occurred during planning. Please delete the plan and create it again later. If the error persists, please contact us.

## Plan information

When you open one of the plans, you will be shown the full plan.

In the plan, you will be able to see the start and end times of each visit, along with the duration of the visit and the travel time between different locations.

There are 5 different types of locations:

- **Start**: This is the starting point you set when you created the plan.
- **Place**: This is a place that is in the Hermes database and that you selected before creating the plan.
- **Break**: Is a rest period, such as lunch time.
- **Waiting**: A waiting period because the next place to visit is not yet open.
- **Custom**: In a custom place, which you have created manually and which is not found in the Hermes database.

If the plan is longer than one day, you can switch between days using the "Previous day" and "Next day" buttons.

### Editing a plan

You can edit an active plan at any time. To do this, click on the "Edit" button.

By activating the edit mode you will be able to, from top and bottom in the interface:

- Move the start date of the plan forward or backward.
- Change the name and description of the plan
- Insert places, breaks, waits or customized places
- Change element durations
- Remove items from the plan
- Add notes

Once you save your changes, Hermes will automatically recalculate all times and refresh the page to display them.
