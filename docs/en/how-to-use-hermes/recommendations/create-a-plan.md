# Create a plan

Creating a plan is as simple as: 

1. Selecting places
2. Planning

## Selecting places

Once you have explored a place, you can add it to a list to create a plan that contains it.

To add a place, once you have opened its information panel on the map, click on the "Add to plan" button. To remove or deselect it from the plan, click on the "Remove from plan" button or the button at the top right of the place card in the list of places.

<figure markdown>
  ![Place information panel](../../assets/recommender/recommender_2.png){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>Panel of information of a place</figcaption>
</figure>

Each time you select a place, it will be marked with a green border in the list of places, as well as changing the color of the "pin" on the map from blue to green.

### Emptying the list of selected places

If you want to empty the list of selected places, click the button at the top of the list of places.

<figure markdown>
  ![Emptying confimation panel](../../assets/recommender/recommender_4.png){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>Emptying confimation</figcaption>
</figure>

Doing so will open a confirmation that you want to empty the selection.

## Plan

Once you have selected a minimum of 3 locations, you can create a new plan by clicking on the "Plan" button.

<figure markdown>
  ![Planning panel](../../assets/recommender/recommender_6.png){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>Planning</figcaption>
</figure>

When you click on this button, a modal window will open in which you will be prompted for the following data:

1. Information
    - Plan name
    - Plan description
2. Hours
    - Duration of the day: Start and end time at which you will start and end the day.
        - Note: Once you set the length of the day, you will not be able to change it later.
3. Starting place
    - Select on the map the place where you are staying during the trip or the place where you want to start every day.
4. Days
    - Duration of the plan: Start and end day on which you will start and end the plan. Based on the data you have provided above, a minimum plan duration will be calculated, so that Hermes can find a plan. If you are not satisfied with the minimum duration, remove places from the plan or increase the duration of the day.
        - **Note**: Once the plan duration is set, you cannot change it later, although you can move the start date forward or backward.

If you wish to add breaks (e.g. for lunch time), you can add them later when editing a plan.
