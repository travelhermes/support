# Explore

The explore panel is made up of two sections: the list of places and the map. In the list of places you can see all the recommendations that Hermes has created for you, and with the map you can put all the places in context and know where they are located.

<figure markdown>
  ![Main screen of the recommender](../../assets/recommender/recommender_1.png){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>Recommendations</figcaption>
</figure>

In the list of places, each place is represented by a "card". In this, the name of the place, its categories, a description, the time of visit, the average score of the site and the confidence of the Hermes prediction are displayed.

**Note**: A score of 0 means that we have no scores for that place yet.

## Information about a place

Clicking on a place, either on the map or in the place listing, will open a panel on the map with information about the place.

<figure markdown>
  ![Place information panel](../../assets/recommender/recommender_2.png){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>Panel of information of a place</figcaption>.
</figure>

From this panel you will be able to see:

- Photographs of the place
- Name
- Address
- Link to Wikipedia (if exists)
- Link to the official website of the site (if exists)
- Link to Twitter (if available)
- Link to Facebook (if available)
- Link to Instagram (if available)

## Search engine

A search engine is located at the top. When you enter a search criteria, the 5 most relevant results will appear.

<figure markdown>
  ![Search bar](../../assets/recommender/recommender_3.png){ width="300" }
  <figcaption>Search bar</figcaption>
</figure>

In the results, you will be able to see the name of the place, its description and its categories, so that you can recognize if it is the place you are looking for quickly. Also, when you click on one of the results, it will be displayed on the map with additional information.
