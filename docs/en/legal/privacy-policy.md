This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding the collection and use of your information when you use the service and informs you of your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

When we say "company", "we", "us", "our", "us", "service" or "services" in this document, we mean Hermes.

At Hermes, we are committed to complying with the GDPR, the CCPA and other privacy regulations on our platform. The privacy of your data -and it's your data, not ours!- is an important issue for us.

In this policy, we explain what data we collect and why, how your data is handled and your rights over it. We promise you that we will never sell your data: we never have and never will.

## Quick summary

We value your privacy very highly. That is why all the data we collect is completely anonymised, as it does not require cookies and is not shared with third parties.

## As a user of Hermes

Our principle is that we collect only what we need and that we will only process this information to provide you with the service you have subscribed to.

We try to use, primarily, services that we host ourselves on the premises, although we may use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain service offerings. These service providers are carefully selected and meet high standards of data protection, privacy and security.

We only share with them the information necessary for the services offered.

This is what it means in practice:

### What we collect

- :fontawesome-regular-id-badge: Name and surname.
- :material-email-open-outline: Email address.
- :fontawesome-solid-asterisk: Personal preferences.
- :fontawesome-solid-star: Ratings of places visited.
- :fontawesome-solid-map: Trip plans.

### How we use it

- You are required to provide us with your email address if you wish to create a Hermes account. This is so that you can log in and personalise your new account, and so that we can send you updates or other essential information.
- It is necessary for you to provide us with personal preferences and ratings of places visited in order to carry out our service, as this is based on recommendations from analysis of this data you have provided us with. These preferences are not shared with third parties.
- A first-party persistent cookie is stored to remember that you are logged in. If you log in to your Hermes account, you give us permission to use cookies so that you don't have to log in every time you log back in. This makes it easier for you to use our platform. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser. You can adjust the cookie retention settings in your own browser. Already stored cookies can be deleted at any time.
- All data we collect is fully protected, encrypted and hosted on a server located in Spain. This ensures that all data on the site is covered by the European Union's strict strict European Union data privacy laws. Your data never leaves the EU.
- All emails are sent using a third party email provider. Emails are sent using GMail. We have disabled open and link tracking on all emails sent. Please see Google's privacy policy for full details.
- When you write to us to ask a question or ask for help. We retain that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondence that we can refer to should you contact us in the future. We use this data only in connection with responding to enquiries we receive.

### Under what conditions

- No information is shared, sent or sold to third parties.
- No information is shared with advertising companies.
- No information is monetised.

## Data retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide you with the services or as otherwise set forth in this policy.

We will also retain and use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Hermes' legal rights.

You can choose to delete your Hermes account at any time. All your data will be permanently deleted 5 days after the deletion request is made in order to avoid security issues, in case a third party has gained unauthorised access to the account.

You can choose to manage and download all your Hermes account data at any time. This can be done from your personal profile.

## Data breaches

If at any time an unauthorised breach of Hermes data should occur, we will notify you within 48 hours, in accordance with the European General Data Protection Act (GDPR). If it does occur, we recommend you change all your passwords and check if you have been a victim of other possible leaks at [have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwnd.com/).

Subsequently, as soon as we know more information about the breach, we will let you know what happened, how it happened and what measures we will put in place to protect your data in the future. Remember that you can download your data at any time from your profile.

## Changes and questions

We may update this policy as necessary to comply with relevant regulations and to reflect any new practices. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will announce it by email.
