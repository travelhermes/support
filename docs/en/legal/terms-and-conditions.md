# Hermes Terms and Conditions

:date: Last update: 20th June 2021

**Thank you for using Hermes!**

When we say "company", "we", "us", "our", "us", "service" or "services" in this document, we mean Hermes.

:fontawesome-solid-circle-exclamation: **Note**: The following terms of service apply only to Hermes and not to Hermes self-hosted, which would be hosted on its own servers and therefore the terms of service are not necessary. For the latter, these terms of service are provided as an additional template, although you are free to change them.

We may update these Terms of Service in the future. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce this to you by email.

When you use our service, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. This applies to any of our current and future products and to any features we add to our service over time. There may be times when we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. These terms contain a limitation on our liability. Our Data Processing Agreement (DPA) under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forms part of these Terms of Service.

If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use this service. Failure to comply with any of the terms below may result in termination of your account. This is a broad statement and means that you should place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about who we are, how we work and keeping an open door to your feedback.

## Account terms and conditions

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Hermes cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

You are responsible for any activity that occurs under your account (including by others who have their own logins under your account).

You may not use our service for any illegal purpose or to violate any laws in your jurisdiction.

You must provide a valid email address to complete the registration process.

You must be a human being. Accounts registered by bots or other automated methods are not permitted.

You may not use bots or automated methods (e.g., web scrapers), to extract data without prior authorization.

## Cancellation and termination

You are solely responsible for properly cancelling your account. An email to cancel your account is not considered a cancellation. Instructions on how to cancel your account can be found [here](../how-to-use-hermes/account/profile/#advanced). We provide a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link.

If you cancel the service, all data will be deleted within 5 days. We cannot retrieve this information once it has been permanently deleted.

You can choose to delete your account at any time.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the service for any reason at any time. Such termination of service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account or your access to your account and site statistics. Hermes reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of the thousands of sites on our service, there may be at least one doing something nefarious.

Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retaliation) against any service customer, employee or company official may result in immediate account termination.

## Modifications to the Service

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of the service at any time without notice.

## Content Ownership, Copyright and Trademarks

Hermes, authored by [Álvaro Galisteo](https://alvaro.galisteo.me), is licensed under the Open Source "General Public License v3.0". This means that you may, with the source code of the service:

- Use the software for commercial purposes.
- Redistribute the software.
- Modify the software.
- Privately use the software.

always under the following conditions:

- Publish the source code when redistributing the software.
- Attach a licence and display a copyright notice of the original author of the software.

You are solely responsible for any content and other material you submit, post, transmit, email or display on, through or with the service.

We do not claim any intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the service. All data on the site is your own. In accordance with the European General Data Protection Act (GDPR), you may download this data at any time from your personal profile.

You may provide us with feedback, suggestions and ideas about the service. You agree that we own all rights to use and incorporate the feedback you provide in any way, including in future improvements and modifications to the service, without payment or attribution to you.

You must not modify another website to falsely imply that it is associated with Hermes.

## Privacy and data security

Main document: [Privacy policy](privacy-policy.md)

We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies and encryption.

All connections to the service are protected by a minimum version of TLS 1.2 and connections outside the HTTPS protocol are not accepted, so all your data in transit is securely encrypted.

To protect your data in case of possible data breaches, we only collect as little personal data as possible and your password is encrypted using the bcrypt algorithm. Moreover, as Hermes is open source, you or third parties can audit the security of the platform.

Hermes may collect information about its visitors. You trust us with your data and we take that trust very seriously. You agree that Hermes may process your data as described in our data policy and for no other purpose.

Each party agrees to treat the other party's data in accordance with (i) all applicable laws; and (ii) reasonably appropriate privacy and security measures to preserve the confidentiality and security of the other party's data.

You own all right, title and interest in and to the data on your website. We do not obtain any rights from you in your website data. We do not use your behavioural information to sell advertisements. We will never collect or store personally identifiable information to abuse the privacy of our users. By using Hermes, you own and control 100% of the data on your website. We will never sell or share your site data.

## General terms and conditions

Your use of Hermes is at your own risk. The service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We take the uptime of our application very seriously. Please visit our status page to see the status of our service.

Hermes does not provide any warranty for the service, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Unless otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the software "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the service is with you. In the event that the service proves defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

We design our services with care, based on our own experience and that of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no one service that will satisfy everyone. We do not guarantee that our services will meet your specific needs or expectations.

In addition, we thoroughly test all of our features before we ship them. As with any software, our services inevitably have some bugs. We monitor the bugs reported to us and work on priority bugs, especially those related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs are fixed and we do not guarantee that the services are completely bug-free.

Technical support is provided by email. Email responses are provided on a reasonable effort basis with no guaranteed response time.

We, as humans, may access your data to assist you with support requests you make and to maintain and safeguard Hermes to ensure the security of your data and the service as a whole.

## Liability

We mention liability throughout these Terms, but to put it all in one section:

You expressly understand and agree that Hermes shall not be liable, at law or in equity, to you or any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Hermes has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or from messages received or transactions conducted through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorised access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) the statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to these Terms of Service or the services, whether for breach of contract, tort (including negligence, whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.

In other words: choosing our services means you are betting on us. If the bet doesn't work out, it's your fault, not ours. We do our best to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure and talent; and, in general, being satisfied. If you decide to use our services, thank you for choosing us.

This agreement shall be governed by the laws of Spain, and the courts of Spain shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters that may arise under or in connection with this agreement.
