These terms contain a limitation on our liability. Our Data Processing Agreement (DPA) under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forms part of these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use this service. Failure to comply with any of the terms below may result in termination of your account.
